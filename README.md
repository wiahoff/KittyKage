# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, December 2024

## Theme
You are not the main character! You are the game and your goal is to kill the main character, this is a reverse of general game tropes. 

## Game Play
Build monoliths which generate you money. Protect these monoliths by purchases units. Keep hurting the player with your units.
Units and building are spawning at the players mouse position.
F - basic follower, very slow, 2 health, 1 contact damage , 1 cost
G - strong base, 10 health, stationary, 1 contact damage, generals 1 coin every five seconds, 5 cost
H - strong follower, slow, 4 health, 2 contact damage, 5 cost
If you kill the player you win.
If you run out of money and units you lose.

## Impediments
The main character took the most amount of time. The AI for the main character is a large decision tree. We thought about added enemies with guns but this ended up being too complex for the main character to handle.

## Implementation
Summon 2 enemy types
Summon 1 base type
Working health bars.
Complex AI controlled main character with several modes (moving, idle, attacking, thinking) 
hearts that can spawn and aid the main character
Assets created for the player, enemies, monolith, backgrounds and player attack. (made by Lauren Cole)
Sounds created for enemies and player. (made by Ethan Brock)
Multiple scenes: win, loss, title, instructions, level
